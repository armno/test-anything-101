# test-anything-101

Learning how to test node code with `test-anything`. http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers

## random notes taken

- my first mistake was a typo. `emoify` instead of `emotify`. awesome!
- `assert` is the simplest way to get started. `assert()` with 1 argument checks for any truthy value. (same with `assert.ok()` i think).
